# Bose-Einstein Condensate Simulation

This code implements a simulation framework for a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), combining the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) with a Metropolis-like stochastic algorithm.

The main source files for running simulations are located in the `/src` directory. The scripts `Harmonic_Trap.py` and `Metropolis_Stochastic.py`, also within `/src`, provide an example of how to utilize the code.
